# Node-Embeddings
Node Embeddings for Community detection and Link Prediction.
The following project is about using node embeddings, more specifically node
to vector,to address some classic problems in the field of network analysis.
The dataset which will be used is the ’Books about US Politics Dataset’
available in the following link (http://networkdata.ics.uci.edu/data/polbooks/).
It is a network of books about US politics edges between books represent frequent 
co-purchasing of books by the same buyers.
The used classifiers for link prediction are 5 Nearest Neighbors,Gaussian Naive Bayes and Decision Tree.
For community detection k-means is used.
